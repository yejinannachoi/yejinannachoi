### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I recently graduated from Emory University with a degree in Business Administration and Quantitative Sciences. This fall, I will begin my Masterâ€™s in Data Science at New York University.

My goal is to use data science skills and my business acumen to solve business problems, create value, and elevate user experiences. Iâ€™m currently seeking internship opportunities for Summer 2025 in data science, analytics, or related fields.
